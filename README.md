Option 2: Personal Finance Tracking Program Write a Python program for personal finance tracking. The program should allow the user to create a budget, input monthly or weekly income, expenses and savings
Name: Personal Finance Tracking Program
Problem: The project aims to provide a personal finance tracker to users. It helps users manage their budgets, track income, expenses, and savings across different periods (monthly and weekly). The main problem being addressed is the lack of a convenient tool for individuals to monitor and analyze their financial situation effectively.

Solutions:
The program implements a Budget Tracker class and a Financial Summary class to manage and summarize financial data. Users can perform the following actions:

1.	Set Budget: Users can set their budget for a specific period (monthly or weekly).
2.	Set Income: Users can set their income for a specific period (monthly or weekly).
3.	Set Expenses: Users can set their expenses for a specific period (monthly or weekly) and specify the expense name and amount.
4.	Set Savings: Users can set their savings for a specific period (monthly or weekly).
5.	Update Income: Users can update their income for a specific period (monthly or weekly).
6.	Update Expenses: Users can update their expenses for a specific period (monthly or weekly) by providing the expense name and amount.
7.	Update Savings: Users can update their savings for a specific period (monthly or weekly).
8.	Generate Summary: Users can generate a summary of their financial data, including budgets, incomes, expenses, and savings for each period (monthly and weekly).
9.	Save Summary to File: Users can save the generated summary to a file.

Program Objectives:

The main objectives of the program are to enable users to:

•	Set and track budgets for different periods.
•	Monitor their income, expenses, and savings for each period.
•	Obtain a comprehensive financial summary to assess their financial situation.

Program Interaction and Purpose:

The program interacts with the user through a command-line interface (CLI). Users can choose from various options such as setting budgets, incomes, expenses, savings, updating financial data, generating summaries, and saving summaries to a file. The purpose is to empower users to manage their personal finances effectively and make informed financial decisions.

Limitations of the Program:

1.	No Data Persistence: The program lacks data persistence, meaning that once the program terminates, all financial data is lost, and users cannot access their historical data in subsequent sessions.
2.	Limited Error Handling: The program provides basic error handling, but it may not be robust enough to handle all possible input errors or exceptions.
3.	Single User Support: The program is designed for a single user, and it does not support multiple user accounts.

Recommendations for Improvement:
1.	Data Persistence: Implement data storage capabilities, such as using a database or saving data to files, to allow users to retain their financial data across sessions.
2.	Enhanced Error Handling: Improve error handling by incorporating more comprehensive validation checks for user inputs and providing meaningful error messages.
3.	Multi-User Support: Enhance the program to support multiple user accounts, enabling families or individuals sharing finances to use the tool collaboratively.
